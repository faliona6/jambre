# Jambre
The quickest and easiest way to find a band to jam, gig, and/or practice with musicians in your area.
## Inspiration
As passionate musicians first entering college, our team realized that the network for connecting Cal Poly musicians is limited. We created a platform that allows musicians to join together and jam!

## What it does
Bandbase is a platform that connects players with band leaders and vice-versa. It allows musicians to play together and form bands. Musicians can find jam sessions in their local areas and request to join them.

## What's next for Bandbase?
implementing a system to change/upload profile and banner pictures
Implementing a system where employers can book Bandbase bands for gigs/performances
Implementing a system to search for bands as opposed to listing all bands
